Who were we?

TronKrazyChain is a remake of KrazyKewlGamez.KrazyKewlGamez was founded Nov of 2018 and did alot of production of Unity3d games but failed miserably because the google playstore banned all 5 of them. I also tryed submitting them to the Apple store and as well, they rejected them. KrazyKewl was determined to carry on and so we did by leaning the neccessary programing languages to create dApps(webApps).A few hacks later of my first few trc20 contracts, KrazyKewlBot was born on telegram.
It uses out trc10 KrazyKewlPlayToken to play a Dice rolling game. It is also a TronWallet to hold and store all your crypto and production on that is on hold and you are about to find out way...

After the production of the bot, I spent time upgrading it and defi appeared out of no where! I spent two weeks in hibernation learning everything I could about it on a programmers end and started KrazyKewlDefi Farm,wrote the neccessary contract,set up a website and launched it with a launch date,great.Upon testing JustSwap,I didn't realize I created a trade pair of KKG20 and trx and a price that was way to low.I than tryed fixing the price but was too late,1 KKG20 was worth 0.000001 trx. I than created KrazyMiningFarmToken and put it on JustSwap at a normal rate and the price than moved to 72 trx. Not wanting no sales because of high token price, I emptied the liquidity to re add the liquidity but by than, an address decided to add my KMFT on JustSwap for 9999trx for 1kmft. I do not have that much trx to buy it back which has now led me to start over

Who are we now...?

To stay away from the KK/KrazyKewl catchy name, TronKrazyChain is used  for a new start as well as to avoid the KK usage as I do not know who or why was doing that to my liquidity or even why. What I am doing is taking full blame for my mistake on JustSwap as I am not a high roller,just a stay at home father with a passion to do and not sit. I could be one of the fathers sitting at home watching the tele but decided for the sack of my sanity lol and my family, I would teach myself programming and did just that.

The goal of TKC is to eventually become multi-chain for the purpose of the telegram bot as well as the website. The telegram bot will have more details below.As of now, I still have contracts and a farm of tokens to use and will be starting a Genesis mining as planned with a date yet to be announced.Another mistake the old use to make was give release dates too soon,a mistake I will make sure won't happen again.During the first two weeks of Genesis,the goal is to provide a KrazySwap that accepts only pairs belonging to TronKrazyChains' Enterprise.By doing so, a third party app(JustSwap) will not be neccessary and a one stop site is why you will want to come.

What tokens should I keep?

Definatly hold onto to:

KrazyKewlGamez20-KKG20:

Will be gettimg replaced with KrazyKewlRewardsToken,pegged at 20trx.I will be applying for all exchanges that accept trc10 trades so those that have been here for the ups and downs will at least feel as though they have lost nothing.Before that happens, I will be going through the list of holders and ensuring the value of this project by doing so.Some is already in curculation but I know who as I kept a good keep on them.When all is this is taking care of,the community will be notified.

KrazyKewlPlayToken-KKPT

Keep KKPT as it is the main token used to play a dice rolling game on telegram with the KrazyBot I created.It is a Tron Telegram wallet as well as a dice rolling game.As some know, you choose the amount of KKPT you want to bet and if you win,you win Double the amount of KKPT but in TRX.So,KKPT being 2trx for 1kkpt, if you pick 6 and the dice lands on 6,you win 4trx. The bot is currently offline as all adjustments and changes are being made.

KrazyMiningFarmToken-KMFT

The token someone took over on JustSwap.Hold it until I replace it.

KrazyDefiToken and MOON token:

They are the tokens that are still not mined.No one has any not even me as the only way to get them is by mining them.They will still be mined exactly as SUN mining worked.There is a whitepaper in the works on the payouts and will be completed after this section. The tokens of choice is yet to be determined.

KKGT-KrazyKewlGamezToken-trc10

The 1st token created and used to play Unity3d dApps with two years ago.I had 5 games released on the Google Playstore and when the big google crypto ban went down,not only was youtube was hit,so was the store and my 5 games were no more.Those tokens became of no use so were upgraded to KKG20.With that being said, many attempts at manual swaps were given as well as a bot on telegram had a swap option.There will be a swap option on the new site and a Wallet address will be posted and a timeline set this time.Alot of KKGT circulation is in the hands of Rain collectors and God only knows where.

What is to come?

The telegram Tron wallet will be back up and running with a new name as well. Upon the creation if my new Telegram account, I did a search on KrazyKewlBot and KrazyBot and to my surprise,found copy cats.The bot will be as it was before,hold trc10 and 20 tokens and will have withdrawal,transfer,tipping and of course the dice rolling game.

The Defi site will start Genesis mining at a undetermined date.It is constantly being updated and when it is time to start,I will be giving a 2 week purchase period of the tokens needed to start mining.One I have already created. The plans for the Defi site is to also implement its own Swap section to start making LP pairs for the rest of the mining process.(Again,technically specs in whitepaper).I will not say everything I plan on implenting into the new site as I do not want to make any unkept promises this time around or costly mistakes to me or the Krazy community.

How can we purchase the tokens used for mining?

Due to my stupid horrible mistake on JustSwap by not knowing much about it as well as definatly not knowing that someone can take what they buy and add it to liquidity at a higher price, there will be two ways to purchase;
1.Directlty through me
2.I will be implementing a buy button on the website that of course will be used with TronLink extension as well as any TronWallet with browsing capability.
